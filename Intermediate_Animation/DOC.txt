MORPHING DATA STRUCTURES

aiMesh:
	unsigned int mMethod - Tells the method of morphing when animMeshes are specified via enum aiMorphingMethod 
	aiAnimMesh* mAnimMeshes[] - attachment meshes for the specific mesh for vertex based animation.
	unsigned int mNumAnimMeshes

aiAnimMesh:
DESC: An attachment to an aiMesh and stores per-vertex animations for a particular frame
The relationship between the Time line and animMesh is established by aiMeshAnim.
	aiVector3D mVertices[] - Replacement for aiMesh's mVertices
	unsigned int mNumVertices
	float mWeight - Weight of the AnimMesh

aiAnimation:
	aiMeshAnim* mMeshChannels[] - The Mesh Animation Channels. Each affects a single mesh
	unsigned int mNumMeshChannels

aiMeshAnim:
DESC: Describes Vertex-based animation for a single mesh or a group of meshes. Meshes carry the animation data for each frame in
their aiMesh::mAnimMeshes array. The purpose of aiMeshAnim is to define keyframes
linking each mesh attachment to a particular point in time.
	aiString mName - Name of the mesh to be animated
	unsigned int mNumKeys
	aiMeshKey mKeys[] - Keyframes of the animation.

aiMeshKey:
DESC: Binds an animMesh to a specific point in time.
	double mTime - The time of this key
	unsigned int mValue - Index into the aiMesh::mAnimMeshes array of the mesh corresponding to the aiMeshAnim hosting this key
						  frame. AKA the connection
